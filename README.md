### Duration:
Approximately 11 hours  .
### Project Description:

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive EDA provided valuable insights into the data. Significant relationships were found between certain predictor variables and the outcome variable (diabetes). Variables like glucose level, bloodPressure, and BMI were found to have strong correlation with the diabetes outcome.

#Data Preprocessing: The dataset was successfully cleaned and preprocessed. This involved handling missing values, detecting and removing outliers, scaling and normalization of features, and handling imbalanced classes through oversampling strategy.

#Model Development and Evaluation: Different machine learning models were trained on the dataset and their performance was evaluated. The models included Logistic Regression, Random Forest. The performance of these models was evaluated using suitable metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

#Model Optimization: The performance of the models was further improved through hyperparameter tuning. Using GridSearchCV, the best hyperparameters for the Random Forest model were determined. This resulted in a best score of approximately 0.89.

#Insights and Findings: The project generated important insights about the factors contributing to diabetes and how different machine learning models can be used and optimized for prediction. It highlighted the role of data preprocessing, EDA, and model optimization in developing robust predictive models.

#Future Directions: The project laid a solid foundation for future work. This could include exploring other predictive models, more in-depth feature engineering.
